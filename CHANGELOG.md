# Changelog

Notable changes to kindling: the core, `kling-vz` and the extensions in `ext/`.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), one line per change.
Binaries for every release are on the [Releases](https://github.com/juan52878911/kindling/releases) page.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `kling image import` stores an image whose layers extend an already imported one (same diff_id prefix, agent and arch) as a small layer over it instead of a second full ext4; a base with layers on top cannot be removed
- `kling template pool <name> -n N` keeps N awake copies of a template; `run -from` claims one in ~10-20 ms instead of restoring (off by default)
- `kling image import -warm [-step CMD]...` goes from a registry ref to a ready template in one command; `kling db golden -from-oci REF build` builds a database golden from a Docker/OCI image (e.g. pgvector/pgvector:pg16) without compiling extensions
- `kling image import -slim` trims Postgres and Timescale images by family rules (LLVM/JIT, bitcode, headers, old extension versions, `jit=off`): postgres:17-alpine 297→91 MiB, postgres:17 457→167 MiB, Timescale 1.6 GiB→187 MiB; `kling save -audit` reports files the running service never opened, without trimming
- `kling image import -ulimit` and `-sysctl`: the guest agent applies them before the service starts (OpenSearch and ClickHouse need nofile and vm.max_map_count)
- `kling db` templates of ClickHouse (`-engine clickhouse`), with the password stored as a SHA-256 computed on the host (#118)
- `kling db` templates that speak the MongoDB protocol through FerretDB (`-engine ferretdb`); copies get a `mongodb://` DSN and a rotated password like Postgres (#117)
- `kling db` templates of Oracle MySQL 8.4 and 9 from the Docker image, with `caching_sha2_password` hashes computed on the host (#114)
- Every copy of a template regenerates its SSH host keys when the image has `ssh-keygen`, and sshd serves the new ones (#176)
- `kling db golden image|build -engine valkey`: Valkey templates, served like Redis (#113)

### Changed

- `kling image import` refuses images with no command and no shell, or with s6-overlay as init, with a clear error; a wrong-architecture image says which side is which; `scripts/bateria-imagenes.sh` checks 10 popular images end to end
- `kling rm` answers once the VM is dead and cleans up in the background; the name is free at once and an interrupted cleanup finishes on daemon start (p50 ~65 → ~37 ms)

### Fixed

- `run -from` no longer pays a ~320 ms resync retry (up to 2 s) on templates saved while the guest agent was not listening: the mark is kept in the signed snapshot meta and the freeze seal
- macOS on M4: OpenSSL no longer dies with `Illegal instruction` in the guest; the agent sets `OPENSSL_armcap` when the guest kernel reports SVE2 without SVE (#183)
- MCP gateway: after a restart, tools of a service whose instance was still running work again; the gateway clears its old sessions and no longer leaks one per catalog fetch (#187)

## [0.18.0] - 2026-10-11

On-disk formats changed: upgrade with `kling upgrade`, which keeps a backup and rolls back on failure.

### Added

- Run Docker images: `kling image import` and `kling run -image`, without Docker or root (#167, #171)
- Private registries: `kling registry login` (#171)
- `kling upgrade`: update kindling in place, with automatic rollback (#138, #171)
- `kling start` boots a stopped machine again (#170)

- Per-tenant quotas (#170)
- `kling db`: Postgres goldens with extensions, faster branches (#125, #143–#150)

- Images build and unpack 2–3× faster (#172, #173)
- `kling stop` keeps the disk and drops the memory (#170)
- Short README; the full guide is `docs/guide.md` (#152)

### Fixed

- `kling run -ttl 0` means never; `run -from` warns about ignored flags (#182)
- Copies of a template reach the template's credentials (#182)
- `kling doctor` lists templates that can't be restored (#182)
- Freezes, saves and thaws check disk and memory first (#170)
- Docker images behave as they do in Docker (#170)
- Shared folders survive restarts and freezes (#142)
- Several race conditions in images, the gateway and networking (#170)

### Security

- Images are built by an unprivileged user (#168)
- Image downloads are verified and size-capped (#167, #171)
- The credential proxy never sends keys to another host (#133)
- macOS: each machine's `kling-vz` runs sandboxed (#131)
- No symlinks followed in jails or sockets; downloads pinned by sha256 (#129, #134, #139)

- `kling graph`: several microVMs with `link`, `depends`, `share` and `credential` edges (#51, #100, #109)
- Copy-on-write disk store: `run -from` no longer copies the whole golden disk (#51)
- Credential proxy for HTTP APIs and Postgres: keys never enter the guest (#47, #48, #49, #50)
- Per-session isolation for MCP services: one microVM per session (#52)
- Per-operation authorization on the daemon socket (#105)
- Android phones on kindling: K1 kernel, image-defined readiness, optional virtio-gpu (#101, #102, #103, #104, #106)

### Changed
